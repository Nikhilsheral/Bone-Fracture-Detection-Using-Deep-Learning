Bone fractures have long been a significant medical challenge, with classification relying  heavily on human interpretation of X-ray images, which can be prone to errors.Leveraging  advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, our research aims to address  this issue by developing a robust solution for the automated identification and classification  of bone fractures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
 Specifically, we explore  modern CNN architectures such as ResNet, DenseNet, and VGG16, among others. Through  iterative fine-tuning of these models, we have achieved classification results surpassing the  predefined confidence threshold established in our study. 
While our results are promising,  further refinement through techniques like Feature Extraction, potentially replacing conventional methods with more  accurate and efficient deep learning-based solutions in the medical domain.
